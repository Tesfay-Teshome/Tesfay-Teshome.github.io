# Book-Cafe
## Book Recommender Web-App

So many books, so little time.

### Team
1. Biruk Gelelcha :- Will work on the Back-end of the project as he has an earlier experience on the backend language he is  planning to use on this project as well as he is energetic.
2. Dagmawi Andualem:- Will work on the Front-end of the project and he has a creative and artistic mind on graphic designs.
3. Tesfay Teshome:- Will work on the Front-end and assist a small portion of the Back-end ambitious to see the fruit of hard work with good experience on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Technologies
### Python
Python is a high-level programming language that can be used for developing websites, operating systems, and applications. It has the most developers and is the most installed software on GitHub among other programming languages. It is also used in many other fields, such as finance and science. For this project, we are planning to use one of the best programming languages of the era: Python. We are using Python because it is becoming more popular and usable for such lightweight projects and because it can build large projects
.
## Flask Web Framework (For the BackEnd)
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.As we are working on a lightweight project we found flask more covenant than some other well known frameworks beside that we are more comfortable working on APIs and CRUD operation with flask.
Flask provides an effective way to organize our project for efficient development. This gives us the best approach to build a website quickly with a great user experience. Additionally, Flaskâ€™s templating engine allows us to dynamically create pages in a modular fashion. Finally, Flask offers great flexibility by providing tools such as URL routing, support for form submissions, and database connections, which makes it ideal for our project.

## JavaScript (For the FrontEnd)
We will use JavaScript for the front end of our project. We will use HTML and CSS to create our designs, but we will also use React to build components that can be reused throughout the entire application. For the frontend, we want to use React as our framework. This will enable us to create widgets that are reusable, which is important for an app with so many different features. It also allows us to focus on writing code rather than thinking about how those components should look and feel.

## Challenges
This project aims to address the issue of wasting time looking for an appropriate book to read at any moment.
The project intends to do this by developing a web-based application that assists users in finding books based on their reading patterns and then suggests other books based on their prior searches. The software will also walk users through the process of downloading, reading, and rating books on their devices.
We anticipated there would be difficulties when we started to embark on this project. But we believed that if we could overcome these obstacles, we'd be able to produce a solution that would help customers save time and acquire the appropriate book at the right moment
As we all know, obstacles are unavoidable in every working environment. Some of them are similar to. Because there are so many books to incorporate in the system, it is necessary to get and organize all of them.
Risks.

## Technical Risks
the potential impact of modifications on a project, system, or complete infrastructure if an implementation does not go as planned. Failure to identify or manage these threats leads to performance deterioration, security breaches, system failures, and higher maintenance time. To ensure early identification of these problems, a reliable analytical solution for technical risk management is required. This will prevent difficulties from happening without warning and dramatically reduce the work necessary to resolve unexpected infrastructure or system faults.

## Non Technical Risks
Inaccurate predictions in software development lead to unfulfilled expectations. Estimates are frequently required in software development projects, although they might be wrong at times. Inaccurate cost, timing, and outcome estimates can lead software development projects to fall short of client expectations.

## Infrastructure
1. Processing of Data
The data obtained from the free book API provider is saved in a local database on our development workstation. This information will be analyzed to find the links between books. The processing will also be utilized to define each book's category. This information will be saved in the database. The data that has been analyzed will be utilized to develop the recommendation system.
2. Data Gathering
   We will need to collect book data in order to create the book recommender system. This data may be obtained from a variety of sources, but for this project, we will request book data using the ISBNdb API. This information will be saved in a local database on our development computer.
   The ISBNdb API allows you to retrieve book data by ISBN. This information covers the title, author, publisher, and other details about the book. This information will be used to develop the book recommendation system.

## Collaboration in github
GitHub is a fantastic collaboration tool. It enables several individuals to collaborate on the same project while keeping everyone on the same page. To begin, one individual must build a repository and ask the other users to join. After all members accept the invitation, they may clone the repository to their own workspace and begin pushing changes. This enables each team member to work independently on their respective duties while still sharing the same codebase. It also makes it simple for members to keep up with changes made by other members and rapidly settle any disagreements that may develop. With GitHub, collaboration has never been easier.

## Tools or Process that will be used for Testing
1. Writing test scripts for each model and function in the project in order to make sure they all perform as intended is known as "unit testing."
2. Integration testing entails examining the relationships between various parts or modules to ensure that they function as intended when combined.
3. System testing examines the general functionality and behavior of the system under various scenarios. It is carried out on the complete system.
4. Acceptance Testing: This sort of testing determines whether a system satisfies user requirements, determining whether the web app is prepared for deployment.

## Existing Solutions
There are so many book recommendation websites out there some of them are:-
* Whichbook.net
* BookBuB.com
* Epicreads.com
### Those are well known once.
And here we are planning on implementing one of these existing sites, and the reason we are planning on doing that is because we see a lack of having world wide books because we are Ethiopian, and we are planning to include Ethiopian books for users who live abroad.
